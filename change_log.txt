Correction added to the function:

cpp

// You must define the total duration of the music here (for example, 240 seconds for a 4-minute track)
total_length = get_mp3_duration(240); // Replace this with the actual music duration

Replace with:

cpp

total_length = get_mp3_duration(file); // Get the real duration time from the audio file using get_mp3_duration(file);

To avoid limiting the audio to only 240 seconds.

Correction added to the function:

cpp

// You must define the total duration of the music here (for example, 240 seconds for a 4-minute track)
total_length = get_mp3_duration(240); // Replace this with the actual music duration

Replace with:

cpp

total_length = get_audio_duration(file); // Get the real duration time from the audio file using get_audio_duration(file);

Explanation:

In this version, we made two important changes:

    Replacement of get_mp3_duration() with get_audio_duration():
        The original get_mp3_duration() function was limited to MP3 files and required the user to manually define the total length (e.g., 240 seconds for a 4-minute track).
        We replaced it with get_audio_duration(), which dynamically calculates the actual duration of the audio file (MP3, OGG, WAV, etc.) by reading its metadata. This eliminates the need for a fixed duration and allows the program to handle a variety of audio formats.

    Switch from mpg123 to FFmpeg:
        The previous version relied on the mpg123 library, which was specifically designed for MP3 playback. However, this limited the program to only support MP3 files.
        We switched to FFmpeg, a more versatile library that supports a wide range of audio (and video) formats, including MP3, OGG, WAV, and others. This transition allows the program to handle different audio file types seamlessly without needing format-specific functions.

By integrating FFmpeg and the get_audio_duration() function, the program now calculates the real duration of any supported audio file, providing more flexibility and accuracy in playback.

Modification made to the audio file search function:

We replaced the use of the `ls` command with `find` to address an issue encountered. The `ls` command failed to correctly list audio files when the specified directory did not contain any subdirectories. As a result, we switched to using `find` to ensure that all audio files are properly located, even in empty directories or those without subfolders.

The new code is as follows:

sprintf(dir_name,"find '%s' -type f -name '*.mp3' -o -name '*.wav' -o -name '*.ogg' >/tmp/tmp.m3u",argv[a]);
system(dir_name);

This approach ensures a comprehensive and robust search for audio files, regardless of the directory structure.
